# Open data based electricity load forecasting
## By David Íñiguez

### Abstract
Electricity is one of the main engines of modern societies. The agents that are involved in the electricity system of a country need to have the best forecasts possible of electricity load in order to ensure that it is correctly supplied, and also to define their action strategies in the market. In this thesis we will focus in the electricity load foreasting for the daily market of the so called Mercado Ibérico de Electricidad (MIBEL), where most of the energy available is auctioned. We studied the State-of-theArt of the electricity demand approaches, specially for short-term predictions, since we are making one-day-ahead estimations. We extracted data from open sources that will be used later for designing and testing different types of models. Based on the performance of the different approaches, we selected a model that efficiently combines both time series forecasting and machine learning, providing a precision close to the offered by the system operator, Red Eléctrica. Finally, we analyzed the relevance of each of the variables involved by using the Shapley values and regularization techniques.

#### Jupyter notebooks
This repo includes all the jupyter notebooks used in this thesis. 
- **Preprocessing notebooks:**
    - _Cities_unified.ipynb_: Used to build the _Cities_unified.csv_ file.
    - _Economy.ipynb_: Used to build both _IPC.csv_ and _PIB.csv_ files.
    - _OpenMeteoAPI.ipynb_: Used to build the _demanda_meteo.csv_ file.
    - _Festivos.ipynb_: Used to build the _Festivos.csv_ file.
    - _Generate_input.ipynb_: Used to build the inputs of the experiment where exogenous variables are relevant.

- **Data exploration:**
    - _Data Exploration.ipynb_: In this notebook we study the dependencies of the electricity load with different factors, such as temperature, the calendar, the hour of the day...     
-  **Experimental Setup**
    -   _Model Selection.ipynb_: Here we test different models (Linear, XGBoost, Autoregressive, ForecasterAutoReg, Deep Learning) on a simple input.
    -   _Skforecast - Forecasters Testing.ipynb_: Testing he ForecasterAutoReg model from the Skforecast library with different machine learning models as regressors.
    -   _Skforecast - Exog - tuning.ipynb_: Experiment with the input generated by _Generate_input.ipynb_, using the ForecasterAutoReg model from the Skforecast library with XGBoost as regressor. We include exogenous variables, perform hyperparameter tuning and compare the results obtained with the ESIOS predictions. One can also visualize the impact of each variable on the model predictions (explainability) using the Shapley Values.
    -   _Explainability - Regularization Path_: Using a linear model, feature selection is performed using L1 regularization, and using the variables selected by this model in the best performing model we fit and tune a ForecasterAutoReg model from the Skforecast library with XGBoost as regressor. Then we use Shapley values to understand the decision-making on the Skforecast model.
- **24 models approach:**
    - _Small Models - Model Selection.ipynb_: We try different types of model, and for each of them we fit 24 models (one per hour of the day) using the same input as Model Selection.ipynb.
    - _Small Models - Base Input.ipynb_: We try once again the same models as _Small Models - Model Selection.ipynb _with the input generated by Generate_input.ipynb.
    - _Small Models - Skforecast.ipynb_: Equivalent to the _Skforecast - Exog - tuning.ipynb_ notebook, but in this case fitting 24 models (one for each hour) instead of one model for all hours.
